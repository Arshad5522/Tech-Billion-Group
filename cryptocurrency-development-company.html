            <h3>CRYPTOCURRENCY EXCHANGE:</h3>
            <p>The associated Blockchain technologies can be used to design, develop and launch super lightweight cryptocurrency exchanges where the users can trade easily. These are peer-to-peer exchanges where users can trade among themselves easily. Looking
                at the volatility of crypto, it is imperative to keep a track on the performance of coins.</p>
            <p>Not just the exchange, several additions can be done which can help the users to transact more easily with intelligence, using AI. On the surface, it may appear deterrent to the exchange norms, but if you look at the application of AI over
                MACD, Bollinger Bands, Stochastic, Ichi Moku and several others, it can really provide a rich experience to the users of exchange. After all, more the transactions, more the commission exchange will make.</p>
            <p>If you are interested to know more about this, please Contact Us and we will be happy to develop one for you.</p>

            <h3>POWER OF TOKENS AS LOYALTY POINTS:</h3>
            <p>We are working on different solutions which aim to leverage the power of tokens as loyalty points. The possibilities are unlimited and can open up a whole new world in the retail industry. This would not just be the loyalty points but can
                also be a road to great financial success for both customers and merchants.</p>

            <h3>LOAN AGAINST COINS:</h3>
            <p>With the upsurge in coin prices, it is lucrative and easy for anyone to encash the coin against money. It certainly is a good short term solution, but who wants to lose coin whose prices are continuously going up? Blockchain blended with escrow
                provides an excellent solution. It is a solution through which coin owners can simply take a loan and still keep the ownership intact. Welcome to this blended world of escrow and Blockchain!</p>

            <h3>LAUNCHING OWN TOKENS, GIVE THEM A VALUE AND EXCHANGE WITH OTHER CRYPTOS</h3>
            <p>At the onset, your tokens may not have value. But it is possible to launch easily and then build the brand to give a value to tokens. It is a snowball, just roll it and will take a shape automatically. Needless to say that it requires several
                associated marketing efforts to gain value of tokens. Launching tokens are possible now. You can build several other solutions to help the users to encash the tokens against cash, products or other crypto.</p>
