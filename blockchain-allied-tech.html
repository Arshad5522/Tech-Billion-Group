            <h3>Stellar Blockchain</h3>
            <p>Stellar is a platform that connects banks, payments systems, and people. Integrate to move money quickly, reliably, and at almost no cost.Stellar is an open-source protocol for value exchange.</p>
            <p>The Stellar protocol is supported by a nonprofit, the Stellar Development.Stellar is an open-source protocol for exchanging money.</p>
            <p>Servers run a software implementation of the protocol, and use the Internet to connect to and communicate with other Stellar servers, forming a global value exchange network. Each server stores a record of all “accounts” on the network. These
                records are stored in a database called the “ledger”. Servers propose changes to the ledger by proposing “transactions”, which move accounts from one state to another by spending the account’s balance or changing a property of the account.</p>

            <h3>Waves Blockchain</h3>
            <p>Waves is an open-source blockchain platform developed, marketed, and operated by Waves Platform AG that allows users to launch their own custom cryptocurrency tokens. Whilst popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum can be traded
                on external exchanges, and Ethereum allows users to create new tokens on the platform using a smart contract, Waves includes this functionality in its core software and wallet.</p>
            <p>Waves NG is making the platform easier and faster. It allows us to handle hundreds of transactions per second and means we are the fastest blockchain in the world.</p>
            <p>Funds are stored in a blockchain address that only you control. You are the only person who can access your crypto assets.</p>

            <h3>Blockchain in IoT Security</h3>
            <p>Blockchain is a huge database that maintains a continuously growing set of data records. Some characteristics are:</p>

            <p><strong>Distributed system:</strong> There is no central computer holding the entire chain. Rather, the participating nodes have a copy of the chain. If someone wants to add a transaction to the chain, all the participants in the network will
                validate it.</p>
            <p><strong>Public:</strong> Blockchain is public means everyone participating can see the blocks and the transactions stored in them. But can’t see the actual content of your transactions it is protected by your private key.</p>
            <p><strong>Decentralized:</strong> No single authority who can approve the transactions or set specific rules to have transactions accepted. That means there’s a huge amount of trust involved since all the participants in the network have to
                reach a consensus to accept transactions.</p>
            <p><strong>Secure:</strong> The database can only be extended, and previous records cannot be changed (at least, there’s a very high cost if someone wants to alter previous records).</p>
            <p>One of the major challenge which IoT is facing today is its security model. IoT architecture is based on client/server model.All devices are identified, authenticated and connected through cloud servers that support huge processing and storage
                capacities. This centralised architecture is making the IoT ecosystem vulnerable if security is not thought of by design.</p>
            <p>The decentralized, autonomous capabilities of the Blockchain make it an ideal component to become a foundational element of IoT solutions.It is not a surprise that enterprise IoT technologies have quickly become one of the early adopters of
                Blockchain technology. We at Techbillion is welcoming this trend by working on this types of projects.</p>

            <h3>Blockchain Solution For Government services</h3>
            <p>Blockchain these days offers a new approach to enhance transparency and collaboration between governments, business and citizens. By registering assets and recording ownership changes on a common, distributed shared ledger, important information
                can be shared widely, seamlessly for true openness. Transactions can be verified close to real time and combined with the extensive use of privacy services make fraud and cybercrime very difficult. Smart contracts — once verified and deployed
                — will always execute. This all helps towards amplifying transparency, building trust and breaking down bureaucracy between government, business and citizens.</p>
            <p>Government services such as visa applications, bill payments and license renewals can be transacted digitally using blockchain.</p>
            <p>Given the un-tamperable data record provided by the technology, real estate is not far behind blockchain disruption either. Aiming to radically transform how people, buy, sell and lease real estate, the government agency tasked with overseeing
                land purchases and approving real estate trades can use blockchain-powered system to help secure financial transactions, electronically record all real estate contracts, and connect homeowners and tenants to property-related billers, such
                as electrical, water and telecommunications utilities.</p>
            <p>Techbillion with its expertise are marching towards this trend.</p>


            <h3>Blockchain Solution For Supply Chain</h3>
            <p>Supply chain sector is valued around €16 trillion.</p>
            <p>Any good produced and distributed through vast network of producers, retailers, distributors, transporters and suppliers. And it passes through complex arrangement of processes for managing contracts, payments, labelling, sealing, logistics,
                anti-counterfeit and anti-fraud.</p>
            <p>The scale and complexity of the systems involved leads to high transactional costs, frequent mismatches and errors in manual paperwork, as well as losses through degradation and theft along the way. Other issues include abusive or unsafe working
                conditions; environmental damage through inefficacies, illegal extraction and production processes; forgery and imitation and health risks through poor supply chain management. Actual processes remain costly and unreliable, especially
                in regions with high levels of corruption.</p>
            <p>Thus, there is a need of new supply chain management for safer, more trustworthy and transparent supply chains of goods and services.</p>
            <p>Blockchain technology can really improve today's supply chains and logistics sector to respond to operational inefficiencies, fraud and perhaps even in unethical labour practices and environmental degradation.</p>
            <p>Blockchain technology is fundamentally about adding trust to an untrusted environment and exploiting a distributed ledger mechanism, supported by the majority of nodes, in a peer-to-peer network in order to create an authoritative record of
                significant events. From a business point of view a blockchain can be defined as a platform whereby peers can exchange values using transactions without the need for a central trusted arbitrator.</p>
